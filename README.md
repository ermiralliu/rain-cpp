A rendition of "Rain Simulator" that better utilizes the features of C++.

Using std::future and async to allow the user to work on the console without interrupting the application.

Using wrapper classes that work like unique pointers.

Press 'r' for vertical rain speed and 't' for horizontal rain speed.

You can press somewhere with the mouse, then the points will follow the direction the cursor goes, and will speed up based on the distance from the initial clicking point. You can click again and they will maintain the same movement as before clicking. 

Other features will be added later on.
