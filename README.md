A rendition of "Rain Simulator" that better utilizes the features of C++.

Using std::future and async to allow the user to work on the console without interrupting the application.

Using wrapper classes that work like unique pointers.

Press 'r' for vertical rain speed and 't' for horizontal rain speed.

Other features will be added later on.
